Scripts for Synthesizer V Studio Pro.

## Microtonal

I recommend binding these to shortcuts to make the process significantly faster.

By default, the EDO note scripts use 31 EDO. You can change the EDO in the script to whatever you prefer.

Existing Pitch Deviation points will be kept and adjusted by the cent difference.

The Pitch Deviation is not smoothed out and has sudden jumps. If the Pitch Deviation is too large, this can be noticeable.

These scripts cannot tell if you use Note Detuning, so avoid using those if you plan on using these scripts.

### Microtonal - Nearest EDO Note

This script adjusts the Pitch Deviation based the nearest note of EDO. By default, the EDO is tuned on A, with A4 being tuned in the Voice settings.
